# Hereâ€™s a Node.js script that simulates rolling two dice and keeps rolling until both dice show the same number, indicating a tie.

## Explanation:
rollDie Function: This function generates a random number between 1 and 6, simulating a die roll.

rollUntilTie Function: This function rolls two dice and checks if they are equal. If not, it keeps rolling until a tie is achieved. It also counts the number of rolls and logs each roll to the console.

Execution: The script starts by calling the rollUntilTie function.
This script will keep rolling the dice until both dice show the same number, and it will print each roll to the console along with the total number of rolls needed to get a tie.
